# Flutterwave Integration Demo Script

## Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hello everyone! Today I'm going to show you how easy it is to integrate Flutterwave payments into a food ordering app. Flutterwave is a powerful payment gateway that allows businesses in Africa to accept payments from customers around the world."

## App Overview (1 minute)
"I've built a complete food ordering application with Next.js that includes:
- User authentication
- A food menu with different items
- Flutterwave payment integration
- Order confirmation and history
- User dashboard

Let me walk you through the entire flow and show you how simple it is to integrate Flutterwave."

## Authentication Demo (1 minute)
"First, let's create a new account. The app has a simple registration form that collects basic user information. In a production app, this would connect to a database using Prisma with PostgreSQL, which I've already set up in the code."

## Menu and Food Selection (1 minute)
"Now that we're logged in, let's browse the menu. We have several delicious options including Jollof Rice, Beef Burger, and Chicken Suya. Each item displays an image, description, and price."

[Browse through the menu items]

"Let's order some Jollof Rice by clicking the 'Order Now' button."

## Flutterwave Integration Highlight (2 minutes)
"This is where Flutterwave comes in. When we click 'Order Now', the app prepares a payment configuration object with details like:
- The Flutterwave public key
- Transaction reference
- Amount and currency
- Customer information
- Customization options

Let me show you the code that makes this happen:"

"The integration is incredibly simple with just a few lines of code:
1. We import the useFlutterwave hook
2. We create a configuration object
3. We initialize the payment with handleFlutterPayment
4. We handle the callback to process successful or failed payments

Now, let's complete the order and see Flutterwave in action."

## Payment Flow Demo (2 minutes)
"When I click 'Order Now', Flutterwave's payment modal appears with multiple payment options. For this demo, I'll use a test card:"

- PIN: 3310
- OTP: 12345

"After successful payment, we're redirected to a success page with order details. Notice the progress bar that gives users visual feedback before redirecting to the dashboard."

## Order History and Details (1 minute)
"Now let's check our order history in the dashboard. Here we can see all our past orders including the Jollof Rice we just ordered."

[Navigate to the dashboard and show order history]

"We can click 'View Details' to see complete information about the order including transaction ID, date, time, and payment method."
